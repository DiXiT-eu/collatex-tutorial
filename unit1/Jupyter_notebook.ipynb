    "There is an esoteric bug in Python that can sometimes cause the launch of IPython notebook on a Windows machine to fail at this point. The symptoms are that the browser opens an unhelpful window that does not look like the IPython notebook workspace described below, and the Power Shell or bash command-line terminal in which you started IPython displays several screens of error messages. The bug has been fixed in Python, and although the new version is not yet part of the Anaconda distribution, you can download it separately and copy the fix over the broken file. To do that, open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python/cpython/master/Lib/mimetypes.py in a web browser and save the file (with the filename mimetypes.py) somewhere convenient, such as your desktop. Then navigate to the Lib directory under your anaconda installation, which should already have a file called mimetypes.py. Move that file to your desktop or somewhere else out of the anaconda hierarchy (change the name, so that you don’t overwrite the file you just downloaded!) and put the newly downloaded copy of the file into the Lib directory in place of the old one. If all goes well, that should enable you to start IPython notebook successfully.\n",
