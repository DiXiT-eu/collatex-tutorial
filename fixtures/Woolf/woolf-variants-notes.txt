When she looked in the glass and saw her
hair grey, her cheek sunk, at fifty, she thought, pos-
sibly she might have managed things better—her
husband; money; his books. But for her own part
she would never for a single second regret her de-
cision, evade difficulties, or slur over duties. She
was now formidable to behold, and it was only in
silence, looking up from their plates, after she had
spoken so severely about Charles Tansley, that her
daughters, Prue, Nancy, Rose—could sport with in-
fidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves
of a life different from hers; in Paris, perhaps; a
wilder life; not always taking care of some man or
other; for there was in all their minds a mute ques-
tioning of deference and chivalry, of the Bank of
England and the Indian Empire, of ringed fingers
and lace, though to them all there was something in
this of the essence of beauty, which called out the
manliness in their girlish hearts, and made them,
as they sat at table beneath their mother’s
eyes, honour her strange severity, her extreme cour-
tesy, like a Queen’s raising from the mud to wash a
beggar’s dirty foot, when she thus admonished them
so very severely about that wretched atheist who
had chased them—or, speaking accurately, been in-
vited to stay with them—in the Isles of Skye.

When she looked in the glass
and saw her hair grey, her cheek sunk, at fifty,
she thought, possibly she might have managed
things better—her husband; money; his books.
But for her own part she would never for a single
second regret her decision, evade difficulties, or
slur over duties. She was now formidable to
behold, and it was only in silence, looking up
from their plates, after she had spoken so severely
about Charles Tansley, that her daughters—
Prue, Nancy, Rose—could sport with infidel ideas
which they had brewed for themselves of a life
different from hers; in Paris, perhaps; a wilder
life; not always taking care of some man or other;
for there was in all their minds a mute questioning
of deference and chivalry, of the Bank of England
and the Indian Empire, of ringed fingers and lace,
though to them all there was something in this
of the essence of beauty, which called out the
manliness in their girlish hearts, and made them,
as they sat at table beneath their mother’s eyes,
honour her strange severity, her extreme courtesy,
like a Queen’s raising from the mud a beggar’s
dirty foot and washing, when she thus admonished
them so very severely about that wretched atheist
who had chased them—or, speaking accurately,
been invited to stay with them—in the Isle of
Skye.

No, the other was also the Lighthouse. For noth-
ing was simply one thing. The other Lighthouse was
true too. It was sometimes hardly to be seen across
the bay. In the evening one looked up and saw the
eye opening and shutting and the light seemed to
reach them in that airy sunny garden where they
sat.
   But he pulled himself up. Whenever he said
"they" or "a person," and then began hearing the
rustle of some one coming, the tinkle of some one
going, he became extremely sensitive to the presence
of whoever might be in the room. It was his father
now. The strain was acute. For in one moment if
there was no breeze, his father would slap the covers
of his book together, and say: "What’s happening
now? What are we dawdling about here for, eh?"
as, once before he had brought his blade down
among them on the terrace and she had gone stiff all
over, and if there had been an axe handy, a knife,
or anything with a sharp point he would have seized
it and struck his father through the heart. She had
gone stiff all over, and then, her arm slackening, so
that he felt she listened to him no longer, she had
risen somehow and gone away and left him there,
impotent, ridiculous, sitting on the floor grasping a
pair of scissors.
   Not a breath of wind blew. The water chuckled
and gurgled in the bottom of the boat where three
or four mackerel beat their tails up and down in a
pool of water not deep enough to cover them. At
any moment Mr. Ramsay (he scarcely dared look
at him) might rouse himself, shut his book, and say
something sharp; but for the moment he was read-
ing, so that James stealthily, as if he were stealing
downstairs on bare feet, afraid of waking a watch-
dog by a creaking board, went on thinking what was
she like, where did she go that day? He began fol-
lowing her from room to room and at last they came
to a room where in a blue light, as if the reflection
came from many china dishes, she talked to some-
body; he listened to her talking. She talked to a
servant, saying simply whatever came into her head.
She alone spoke the truth; to her alone could he
speak it.

Where is it—the blue dish?" She alone spoke
