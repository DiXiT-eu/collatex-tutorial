## Presentation
This repository hosts materials for the workshop **Code and Collation: Training Textual Scholars**, that takes place in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) from 2 through 4 November 2016. The event is part of the [DiXiT network](http://dixit.uni-koeln.de/) and is hosted by the [Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/?lang=en). It brings together a group of international experts from the fields of textual scholarship and computer science.

The workshop engages with the theory and practice of semi-automated collation and provides an intense training in the open source collation program CollateX. Participants will learn how to prepare source materials, how to perform semi-automated collation using CollateX, and how to inspect and modify the results; they will acquire or improve computational skills relevant to textual criticism and in particular to the production of scholarly editions.
